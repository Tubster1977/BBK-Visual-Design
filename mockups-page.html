        Figures 7a-7d represent four desktop pages with important information
        that encourages registered users to sign in. This was not used in my
        final React Project but is a fundamental aspect if the project were to
        go live.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processed <a href="images-page.html">images</a> were used as
        headers, with the transparency reduced in order for less interference
        with text. Each page would be loaded by selecting the relevant blue
        circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main font was Helvetica, but I now know that this is not PC friendly
        and would need to be changed. The large font is in Montserrat as it is
        has clear rounded letters with generous spacing that nicely accommodates
        a nature-focussed website.

        Figure 7e represents a page (tablet view) that would be loaded if the
        'Find Out More' button were to be clicked. The BPCT logo is replaced
        with a home icon so that users can navigate back easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt the information links would enable users to feel part of an
        active community whilst also encouraging unregistered users to join. I
        originally had a Register link on the nav bar but felt it looked clumsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've continued with the theme of using pastel colours as they are both
        warm and inviting. Pastel colours appear fashionable across many
        websites, but they also create a sense of safety which I believe is
        important for a community website.

        Figure 7f represents an overlay (mobile view) that would be loaded if
        the 'Sign-In' button were to be clicked. There is a simple procedure for
        signing in, together with a option for re-setting a password if users
        have forgotten their details.
      </p>
      <p>
        I included a link for registering, which would take the user on to a
        separate page. I felt this looked a little neater here as opposed to the
        navbar but I realise that this could cause confusion and would require
        user experience testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I blurred out the footer so as to discourage both registered and
        unregistered users from using the social media icons to find further
        information about signing-in.
