        Fig 1A – 1C are different versions of the same image. The image in Fig
        1A was taken using the camera on my smart phone (with the image format
        being jpeg).
      </p>
      <p>
        I used an app called Prisma to transform the image in Fig 1A to the
        image in Fig 1B. The app uses an algorithm to apply a range of augmented
        skins.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then used Affinity Photo to ‘clean’ the image in Fig 1B by using the
        selection brush tool followed by adding a new adjustment layer in which
        I increased the brightness and decreased the contrast in order to
        minimise the markings on the sky. I then experimented with the
        refinement tool to remove the heavy scoring on the bottom right of the
        image, the result of this being Fig 1C.

        I didn’t process images 2B, 3B or 4B further on Affinity Photo as I was
        happy with the foreground and sky on each of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photos 1B, 2B, 3B and 4B had a 2:1 ratio which I wanted to maintain as
        it’s a ratio that I felt would work for the headers in my web
        development project. They were however all too large to be used for the
        web so I had to make adjustments. Using Preview (on my mac), I reduced
        the size of these images to 1500 by 729 pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage, the file sizes were still too big, so I used affinity
        photo to reduce the quality such that each image came to 500kb of data
        which was more acceptable than the original 1.5Mb (for each file).

        Fig 5A is an image taken on my digital camera and is a jpeg
        representation of a raw file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shooting in low exposure allows me to then bring out the large depth of
        stored tones and colour data within the raw file. This was done using
        saturation and light level tools on my photo-editing software of choice
        - Luminar 4. The image was then exported as a jpeg file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of this work was Fig 5B. Affinity Photo was then used to
        reduce the file size and this occasion I also used Affinity Photo to
        reduce the image size. Note: I opted not to crop the image but leave it
        in its 3:2 ratio as this was not going to be used as a header.

        Fig 6 is my logo which I designed using Affinity Designer. The font is
        Montserrat, which is a font style I regularly use in web development as
        I like the distinctiveness off the lettering and the curves which have a
        nature-based aesthetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image is stored as a .png file as it’s a lossless compression file
        format perfect for logos. As the file is lossless, it also makes it
        perfect for transferring on to backgrounds whilst maintaining its
        integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had downloaded the plant leaf image and the camera aperture image
        (both .svg files) from flaticon. I used .svg files as they are
        vector-based, making the images more crisp and visually appealing for
        graphics such as logos.
