        The Gif shown in Figure 8a utilises the
        <a href="images-page.html">processed images</a> shown in Figures 1a, 1b
        and 1c. I wanted to show a transition from a normal photo to an
        augmented image (with an 'impressionistic' skin), to a cleaner more
        finalised look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gif creates a stylish effect that shows the evolution of the image.
        I liked how the scoring on the bottom right of the image disappears and
        the way in which the sky becomes both smooth and bright.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite cropping and compressing the file, the size remains
        very large at over 7MB. I therefore wouldnt use it until I could
        compress it further without overly compromising its finish.

        The Gif shown in Figure 8b is the plant leaf on my logo. I used both the
        original image (once I converted it from a .svg to .png file as the Gif
        generator didn't accept the former) as well as an altered version of
        that file with different coloured layers (done on Affinity Designer).
      </p>
      <p>
        The transition between the original and altered image shows an
        intentional seasonal change from summer to autumn. The Gif could be used
        as a loading image following some kind of form submission for my React
        Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file size is only 275kB and I think the size of the image is apt for
        a loading page but the jagged edges could be further edited to give the
        Gif a smoother finish.

        The Gif shown in Figure 8c is the camera aperture that also appears on
        my logo. I again used two images, both of which were edited versions of
        the original (which was also converted from a .svg to .png file). The
        layers for both files had different colours (again done using Affinity
        Designer).
      </p>
      <p>
        The transition between the two files had the desired effect of embracing
        both light and colour, which is important in photography. This Gif could
        be used as a loading image following some kind of form submission for my
        personal photography website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file size is 455kB which is a little large but I think the size of
        the image is apt for a loading page.
